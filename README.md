## The Project

Let's write some code!

You will build an app that lets people create and manage a todo list. Users of your app will be able to add items to their todo list and mark items as "done".

### Getting Started

  0. Download the zip file located [here][./skeleton.zip]
  0. unzip and navigate to the directory
  0. `npm install`

### Scripts
  0. `npm run serve` --> hosts your project on localhost:8080
  0. `npm run pack` --> starts the module bundler

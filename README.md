## The Project

Let's write some code!

You will build an app that lets people create and manage a todo list. Users of your app will be able to add items to their todo list, mark items as "done", and save their todo lists for later.

### Getting Started

  0. Download the zip file located [here](skeleton.zip)
  0. unzip and navigate to the directory
  0. `npm install`

### Scripts
  0. `npm run serve` --> hosts your project on localhost:8080
  0. `npm run bundle` --> starts the module bundler

### Parts

In [Part 1](part_1.md), we'll build the basic redux structure to manage our todo list application.
In [Part 2](part_2.md), we'll add redux middleware to handle saving our todo list!
